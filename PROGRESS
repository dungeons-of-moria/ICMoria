( source can be found at wbcms.cc.buffalo.edu in maslib/games/imoria )

Started on nov 16, 1997.  Got the source, un-sharded it!
nov 17, actually started converting stuff.
nov 22, finished with most of the types/vars/values, time to recode!
dec 7,  you can create a character and get initial inventory and spells!

1998
march 1, you can actually play the game now

june, mid, Jeanetta started some alpha testing.  wow, lots of bugs.
	   Actually working on the code again (had to fix J's crashes)

july 10, I don't seem to be keeping this log up to date at all :)

	All but about 8 files are "done".

	No crashes in a while, except when loading damaged save files.
	encrypts save files, high scores work working on wizard
	commands (wizard passwords work now so you don't have to
	use gdb to set it)

	Master file is in place, uses gdbm.

	Insurance, Help and Trading Post are the only major things left

	(want to have a black market so single system users can benifit)

july 11:
	insurance is done

july 12:
	added encrypt and decrypt switches (-E and -D) for save files
	help is done

	running out of stuff before the post has to be done :)

july 13:
	moved everything up and left by one, icky macros do the job
	but I did not want to edit every single prt/print/..., fixed right
	edge

	get_char bails if any lines are bad.
	
	bolts and balls are visable now!

july 18:
	hmmm, done with the post.  is that everything?

			on the dungeon floor

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
