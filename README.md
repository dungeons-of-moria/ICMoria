# ICMoria 4.85.22

This repository contains the source code for the ICMoria roguelike game, developed by Stephen Kertes between 1997 and 2003.

ICMoria was ported from [Imoria](https://github.com/dungeons-of-moria/imoria), which itself was based on [Moria](https://github.com/dungeons-of-moria/vms-moria), and is a part of the Rogue and Nethack family of dungeon games with character graphics.

Kertes noted that most of the development work was done on Slackware. Around 2002 he got it running under Red Hat 5.1 - although a lot of the encryption code had to be rewritten because of missing libraries on RH. In Aug 2003 he found out that it also works on a custom RedHat 6.2.

It's unkown what other systems ICMoria will compile and run on.
